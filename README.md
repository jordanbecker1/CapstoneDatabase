# CapstoneDatabase

Welcome to the CapstoneDatabase GitHub repository! This group project aims to provide a platform for students to upload and share their capstone projects, which are typically semester-long college projects. By hosting these projects in one central location, we aim to create a valuable resource for students seeking inspiration, guidance, or collaboration opportunities for their own capstone projects.
